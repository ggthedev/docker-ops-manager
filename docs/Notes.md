# Traefik & Web-App Troubleshooting Notes

## 1. Problem Statement
- Traefik container repeatedly unhealthy; health check timeouts.
- Web-app service returns 504 Gateway Timeout or 404 when accessed via Traefik.
- API service routing works, but web-app does not.

## 2. Troubleshooting Steps & Findings

### Health Check Issues
- Traefik's health check was configured to check endpoints that return 404 (not 200), causing the container to remain unhealthy.
- Health check endpoints tried: `/`, `/api/overview`, `/api/rawdata`, `/api`, all returned 404.
- Solution: Health check should target a valid endpoint that returns 200, or be disabled for Traefik if not needed.

### Web-App Routing Issues
- Web-app container was running and healthy, but Traefik returned 504 Gateway Timeout or 404.
- Traefik logs showed: `Defaulting to first available network ... for container "/web-app".`
- Root cause: Traefik could not reach the web-app on the correct network due to Docker Compose limitations with external networks.
- Manual fix: Start web-app with only the `traefik` network attached using:
  ```sh
  docker run -d --name web-app --network traefik -v /path/to/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:alpine
  ```
- After this, Traefik could reach the container, but still returned 404 for `/`.

### Traefik Dashboard & API
- Dashboard and API endpoints (e.g., `/dashboard/`, `/api/rawdata`) returned 404.
- Traefik config had `api.dashboard: true` and `api.insecure: true`, but dashboard was not accessible.
- Possible cause: Traefik v2.x dashboard path or config mismatch.

## 3. Next Actions
- Inspect Traefik's discovered routers and services to confirm if the web-app router is created and matches the expected rule.
- Double-check web-app container labels for correct router rule and entrypoint.
- Consider disabling or relaxing the health check for Traefik if not strictly needed.
- Review Traefik documentation for dashboard/API exposure in v2.x.

---

**Summary:**
- API service routing works, web-app routing does not (returns 404).
- Traefik is running and can reach containers on the `traefik` network.
- Health check failures are due to invalid endpoint selection.
- Dashboard/API not accessible, likely due to config or version specifics.

# Generate vs Install Operations

## Overview
Understanding the key differences between `generate` and `install` operations in Docker Ops Manager.

## Generate Operation

**Purpose**: Creates containers from YAML files for the first time

**What it does**:
1. **Reads YAML files** (docker-compose.yml, custom YAML, etc.)
2. **Extracts container configuration** from the YAML
3. **Creates containers** using Docker commands
4. **Stores metadata** in the state file for future reference

**Usage**:
```bash
./docker-manager.sh generate docker-compose.yml
./docker-manager.sh generate app.yml my-container
```

**Key characteristics**:
- **Source**: YAML files
- **First-time creation**: Creates containers that don't exist yet
- **Configuration**: Uses the YAML file as the source of truth
- **State tracking**: Records the YAML file path and container info in state

## Install Operation

**Purpose**: Recreates containers from previously stored configurations

**What it does**:
1. **Retrieves stored information** from the state file
2. **Finds the original YAML file** that was used to create the container
3. **Recreates the container** using the same YAML configuration
4. **Updates state** with new container information

**Usage**:
```bash
./docker-manager.sh install my-container
./docker-manager.sh install nginx-app web-app
```

**Key characteristics**:
- **Source**: State file (which references the original YAML)
- **Recreation**: Recreates containers that were previously generated
- **Dependency**: Requires the container to have been generated before
- **State lookup**: Uses stored metadata to find the original configuration

## Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | Generate | Install |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Input** | YAML file | Container name |
| **Purpose** | First-time creation | Recreation from state |
| **Dependency** | None (creates new) | Requires previous generation |
| **State** | Creates state entry | Reads existing state |
| **Use case** | New container setup | Container recovery/rebuild |

## Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: Generate container from YAML (first time)
./docker-manager.sh generate docker-compose.yml web-app

# Step 2: Later, if you need to recreate the container
./docker-manager.sh install web-app

# Step 3: Or if you want to update/reinstall
./docker-manager.sh update web-app
```

## With --no-start Flag

Both operations now support the `--no-start` flag:

```bash
# Generate without starting
./docker-manager.sh generate docker-compose.yml --no-start

# Install without starting  
./docker-manager.sh install web-app --no-start
```

## Error Scenarios

**Generate fails when**:
- YAML file doesn't exist
- YAML syntax is invalid
- Container already exists (unless --force is used)

**Install fails when**:
- Container was never generated before
- State file is missing or corrupted
- Original YAML file no longer exists

## Implementation Notes

- **Generate**: Uses `generate_from_yaml()` function that processes YAML files directly
- **Install**: Uses `install_container()` function that calls `generate_from_yaml()` with stored YAML path
- **State Management**: Both operations update the state file with container metadata
- **--no-start Flag**: Both operations respect the flag to create containers without starting them

# Animation Display Issue Fix

## Problem Statement
During container generation, extraneous characters (specifically "i") were appearing in the output after progress animations. The issue manifested as:

```
...ℹ Waiting for container 'nginx-app-container' to be ready (timeout: 60s)
```

Where the dots (`...`) from the animation were not being properly cleared before the next message was printed, causing visual artifacts.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by race conditions in the animation system:

1. **Line Clearing Logic**: The `printf "\r%*s\r"` commands were using dynamic width calculations that weren't working correctly
2. **Timing Issues**: There was insufficient delay between stopping animations and printing the next message
3. **Animation State**: The signal-based animation system wasn't properly clearing the terminal line before new content was displayed

## Solution Approach

### 1. Fixed Line Clearing Logic
**Problem**: Dynamic width calculations in `printf "\r%*s\r" $((dots_count + 1)) ""` were unreliable
**Solution**: Changed to fixed width of 80 characters: `printf "\r%*s\r" 80 ""`

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/utils.sh`: Updated all animation functions to use consistent line clearing

### 2. Added Explicit Line Clearing
**Problem**: Race conditions between animation stopping and next message printing
**Solution**: Added explicit line clearing before showing waiting messages

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/container_ops.sh`: Added `printf "\r%*s\r" 80 ""` before `print_info` calls

### 3. Added Timing Delays
**Problem**: Insufficient time for animations to fully clear
**Solution**: Added small delays (`sleep 0.1`) after stopping animations

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/container_ops.sh`: Added delays after `stop_signal_animation` calls
- `lib/utils.sh`: Enhanced `stop_signal_animation` with additional line clearing

### 4. Enhanced Animation Cleanup
**Problem**: Animation processes weren't properly cleaning up terminal state
**Solution**: Added explicit line clearing in animation cleanup functions

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made

1. **Consistent Line Clearing**:
   ```bash
   # Before (problematic)
   printf "\r%*s\r" $((dots_count + 1)) ""
   
   # After (fixed)
   printf "\r%*s\r" 80 ""
   ```

2. **Explicit Pre-Message Clearing**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure any previous animation is fully cleared
   printf "\r%*s\r" 80 ""
   print_info "Waiting for container '$container_name' to be ready..."
   ```

3. **Animation Stop Delays**:
   ```bash
   stop_signal_animation
   # Small delay to ensure animation is fully cleared
   sleep 0.1
   ```

4. **Enhanced Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure line is cleared after animation stops
   printf "\r%*s\r" 80 ""
   ```

## Testing Results

**Before Fix**:
```
...ℹ Waiting for container 'nginx-app-container' to be ready (timeout: 60s)
```

**After Fix**:
```
ℹ Waiting for container 'nginx-app-container' to be ready (timeout: 60s)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Terminal Animation Timing**: Even small race conditions can cause visual artifacts
2. **Line Clearing Consistency**: Using fixed widths is more reliable than dynamic calculations
3. **Animation State Management**: Proper cleanup is essential for multi-step processes
4. **User Experience**: Clean output is crucial for professional tool appearance

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a more robust animation system with better state management
- Add animation debugging capabilities for troubleshooting similar issues
- Consider using a dedicated terminal library for complex animations
- Implement animation queuing to prevent overlapping animations

# Interactive Menu System for Generate Command

## Problem Statement
The generate command was limited to only working with YAML files, requiring users to have pre-existing YAML configurations. Users wanted the ability to:
1. Generate containers directly from existing Docker images
2. Use an interactive menu system for easier configuration
3. Preview docker run commands before execution
4. Configure various container options (ports, volumes, environment variables, etc.)

## Solution Approach

### 1. Interactive Menu System
Implemented a comprehensive menu-driven interface that guides users through container generation:

**Main Menu Options:**
- Select YAML file
- Select Docker image
- Build from Dockerfile
- Configure port mapping
- Configure volume mounting
- Configure environment variables
- Configure custom network
- Configure resource limits
- Build only (no run) - Show docker build command
- Generate container with current configuration
- Cancel

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-step Configuration**: Users can configure multiple options in any order
- **Clean Menu Interface**: Simple, uncluttered menu without real-time status display
- **Flexible Workflow**: Configure options first, then generate when ready
- **Final Summary**: Shows all selected parameters at the final build stage

### 2. Command-Line Interface Enhancement
Added new command-line flags to support direct image generation:
- `--image IMAGE_NAME`: Specify Docker image to use
- `--container-name NAME`: Specify container name

### 3. Configuration Options
Each submenu provides specific configuration options:

**Port Mapping Menu:**
- Web server (80:80)
- HTTPS (443:443)
- Database (3306:3306)
- Monitoring (8080:8080)
- Custom port mapping
- No port mapping

**Volume Mapping Menu:**
- No volume mapping
- Custom volume mapping

**Environment Variables Menu:**
- No environment variables
- Custom environment variables (KEY=value,KEY2=value2)

**Network Menu:**
- Use default bridge network
- Select from existing custom networks
- Create new network

**Resource Limits Menu:**
- No resource limits
- Memory limit only
- CPU limit only
- Both memory and CPU limits

### 4. Docker Command Preview
Implemented a preview system that shows the exact `docker run` command that will be executed:

```bash
docker run --name my-container -p 80:80 -v /host/path:/container/path -e KEY=value --network my-network --memory 512m --cpus 0.5 -d nginx:latest
```

### 5. Build-Only Mode
Added option to build Docker images without creating containers (emulates `--no-start` for both Dockerfile builds and existing images):

**Features:**
- **Dockerfile Build**: Shows `docker build` command preview and builds image without container creation
- **Image Preview**: Shows `docker run` command preview for existing images without container creation
- Provides helpful instructions for running the built/previewed image later
- Validates Dockerfile existence and build context
- Validates existing image availability

**Examples:**
```bash
# Dockerfile Build-Only:
# Select option 3 (Build from Dockerfile)
# Select option 9 (Build only - no run)
# Shows: docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t app-image:latest .
# Builds image and provides: docker run app-image:latest

# Image Preview-Only:
# Select option 2 (Select Docker image)
# Select option 9 (Build only - no run)
# Shows: docker run --name my-container -p 80:80 -d nginx:latest
# Provides command without creating container
```
